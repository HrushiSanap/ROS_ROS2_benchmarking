# ROS_ROS2_benchmarking
A systematic performance benchmarking study of ROS vs. ROS 2 middleware. This research evaluates intra-board and inter-board communication metrics including latency, throughput, and bandwidth. Results demonstrate ROS 2’s superior scalability and real-time efficiency via DDS, offering 3x–28x latency improvements for high-frequency robotics.
